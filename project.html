                            <li>Build automations regression suite for their web-based applications using Selenium, Cucumber,Web driver,

                            We used an agile methodology during my time in Sparta using kanban board in Jira and to report bugs for any errors
                            caught during the test run, we also used JIRA to cover manual testing, creating Test Executions and Test Plans
                            for each run covering the steps and evidence with screenshots.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Git was used to create Pull Request and CI/CD to integrate with the different environments using pipelines that were set up for the project by the team.
                            I covered manual testing for the new website that was launched last year for all the back end microservices
                            and third-party vendors to cover integrations with the system.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Additionally, we used GCP as a cloud service for our apps which we covered both in manual and automation testing. Confluence was used to document the
                            automations systems we build and as a reference to represent the source of truth.

                            <li>We followed an agile approach with the project again using an agile methodology using Jira boards to gather requirements from the Business Analysts, Bug management
                                and capture tasks, bugs and new functionalities or asks from the business.
